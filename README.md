# King of the fools

You can deposit ETH or USDC into a TreasureChest smart contract, as long as it's at least 1.5x more money than the previous person.
If you do that, you become "King of the fools", and your money gets sent back to the previous person.

## Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
